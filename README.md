The repository all about the ML case study with different algorithms.

Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence. In machine learning techniques
we teaches our machine how to learnt the things by ourself.

Where machine learning also categorized in following types:-
1. Supervised Machine Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
3. Reinforcement Machine Learning

1. Supervised Machine Learning :-
    Basically the data/dataset which given to us for preparing the ML model which are in labled format are
    comes under the Supervised Machine Learning Techniques.
    Means the record having specific label this concept comes under the supervised machine learning technique.
    
    Supervised Machine Learning Categorized in the following :-
    1. Classification :- The data which can be classified as yes or no or according to the some things which comes 
                         under the Supervised machine learning with Classification.
                         e.g :- DecisionTreeClassifier, KNearestNeighbor , RandomForest etc
    2. Regression     :- In the regression the dependent variable changes according to the independent variable.
                         the dataset which linearly change the target column according to the feature are comes
                         under the Regression supervised machine learning technique.
                         e.g :- LinearRegression, LogisticRegression.
