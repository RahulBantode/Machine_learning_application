Diabetes Predictor :- 

problem statement :- In this case study, we have prepare Machine Learning model which predicts the patient having diabetes or not
according to the records which provided in the dataset.

Dataset volume :- 768 record with shape of (768,9) where 768 rows and 9 columns.
In the dataset of 9 columns , 8 columns are the features of the diabetes and 1 column which are the label for that record as
person having diabetes or not.

To prepare the model and to get better accuracy in training and testing. I use the different variation of the model which are as follows:-
*  SingleTon Algorithm technique.
1. DecisionTreeClassifier
2. KNeighborsClassifier
3. LogisticRegression

*  Ensemble Algorithm technique.
5. RandomForestClassifier
6. BaggingClassifier

To visualization of dataset,I used matplotlib,pandas library to viewing the graphical representation of data.

conclusion :- Due to the inconsistency in the dataset we not reach the as much accuracy which we want.
